    <p>Hello! My name is Alex Caviness, and I was born in California, grew up in Illinois, and now live in Tennessee while going to school in North Carolina. I am studying mechanical engineering because I like designing and making cool things. I want to design microelectromechanical systems, probably. I am most interested in taking the design classes because I like designing and building objects. This class has been looking promising so far, and I'm excited for Junior and Senior Design down the road.</p>
    
    <p>I would consider cooking and violin-playing to be among my strengths and painting and sculpting among my weaknesses. My bucket list includes skydiving, backpacking the entire Appalachian Trail, living in a foreign country, visiting all the continents (perhaps barring Antartica), and taking cooking classes. As a sidebar, I am also majoring in music because I have played the violin for too long for me to be able to stop--the inertia is simply too great. I spent more time on this assignment than I have to show for it, and I learned that CSS isn't worth the time. </p>
    
    <p>Favorite Painting:</p>
