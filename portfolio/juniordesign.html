    <h1>Junior Design Project</h1>

    <p>This is a project I worked on with a group of five other people. Our goal was to build a compact and remotely-controlled robot that could maneuver between obstacles and transport spheres. Our project description is <a href="files/ProjectDescription.pdf">here</a> and a drawing of the course is <a href="files/jrdesigncourse.PDF">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Our robot used a PS3 controller to connect to a Arduino over Bluetooth to control the robot which was assembled out of rapid prototyped and machined parts. It had two magnets on the end of the crane arm to pick up the two 1" 0.5 lb steel ball bearings simultaneously. There was a stabilizing arm to balance the robot when engaging and disengaging the spheres since the robot only weighed 2.6 lbs.</p>
