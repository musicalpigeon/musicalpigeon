    <h1>C.O.R.E.</h1>

    <p>The Calisthenics Outdoor Recreational Equipment (C.O.R.E.) is a project that concluded in September of 2019! Three other students and I worked to bring this project to fruition after noticing a lack of available and diverse fitness spaces on UNC Charlotteâ€™s campus and wanting to increase the number of outdoor options. The project began in 2016 and has involved writing grant proposals, budgets, making partnerships with several campus departments, designing the course, and marketing.</p>
